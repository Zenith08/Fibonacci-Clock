### **Fibonacci Clock (time-zone)**

Create a basic application which displays to a user:

- What the current time is in 3 of your favorite cities
  - At least 2 should be in different time zones
- The interface must display the number of degrees between the two hands of a clock with the current time.
- A Fibonacci sequence of alarm durations
  - When the application is started (t₀ = time when app is started) an alarm will notify the user, alarms are scheduled by a time as determined by the Fibonacci sequence. (duration between alarms are the Fibonacci sequence outputs in hours), where the tₙ₊₁ is the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
  - (t₁ = 1hr, t₂ = 1hr, t₃ = 2hrs, …)
- The App shows how long it will be until the next alert.
- There is an emphasis on front-end implementation and visual structure.
- Note: this should be all your own written code. You may use this link to understand the math for the degrees https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_angle_problem

**Submission**

- You may choose any framework/technology you want (ie. .NET MAUI, Flutter, React, etc.)
- Please include any assumptions you made in a README along with instructions on how to compile and test your code.
- UI/UX should be clean and minimalistic that is easy to navigate and understand.
- Write clean, well-organized code following best practices.
- Use an appropriate design pattern (e.g., MVVM, MVC, etc.) to ensure the separation of concerns. Please include the front-end design pattern you chose in the README.
- Please include comments and documentation where necessary to explain your code and decisions.

Submittable: Please Upload your code base to Github (or the like) and email us a link to this repository. (Please have a readme which lays out how to locally deploy your code)
